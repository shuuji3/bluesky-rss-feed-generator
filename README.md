# @shuuji3/bsky-rss 🦋

A minimal Node.js application to generate Bluesky RSS feeds including replies, which are not supported by the official RSS feeds.

Built with [atcute](https://github.com/mary-ext/atcute), [Hono](https://hono.dev/), and [feed](https://github.com/jpmonette/feed).
This tool can be used as a standalone CLI or as a proxy server.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was **almost entirely generated by an LLM** (model: [gemini-3-flash-preview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/3-flash)) as a jig for personal usage. It has **not been fully reviewed** so something might be wrong. I have little experience on Hono yet. 🥲

## Installation

```bash
# Using pnpm dlx (like npx)
pnpm dlx @shuuji3/bsky-rss <command>

# Or install globally
pnpm add -g @shuuji3/bsky-rss
```

## Usage

### Generate RSS (CLI)

Generate an RSS feed for a specific Bluesky user and output it to stdout.

```bash
bsky-rss generate <handle-or-did>
```

Example:
```bash
bsky-rss generate bsky.app > feed.xml
```

### Start Server

Start a proxy server that serves RSS feeds via HTTP.

```bash
bsky-rss serve --port 3000
```

Access the RSS feed at: `http://localhost:3000/rss/[handle_or_did]`

Example:
- `http://localhost:3000/rss/bsky.app`
- `http://localhost:3000/rss/did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur`

## Development

Requires Node.js v25 or later (for native TypeScript support).

```bash
pnpm install
node src/cli.ts generate bsky.app
```
