# Bluesky RSS Feed Generator 🦋

A minimal Node.js application to generate Bluesky RSS feeds including replies, which are not supported by the official RSS feeds.

Built with [atcute](https://github.com/mary-ext/atcute), [Hono](https://hono.dev/), and [feed](https://github.com/jpmonette/feed).

> [!NOTE]
> This project was **almost entirely generated by an LLM** (model: [gemini-3-flash-preview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/3-flash)) as a jig for personal usage. It has **not been fully reviewed** so something might be wrong. I have little experience on Hono yet. 🥲

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

3. Access the RSS feed:
   `http://localhost:3000/rss/[handle_or_did]`

   Example:
   - `http://localhost:3000/rss/bsky.app`
   - `http://localhost:3000/rss/did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur`
